# SneakySnap

SneakySnap is a Python-based application designed to capture webcam photos at user-defined intervals and send them to a Discord webhook. It features a clean GUI for configuration and a robust backend for processing, with detailed logging for transparency and debugging.

## Features
- **Customizable Delay**: Set the interval (in seconds) between photo captures.
- **Dynamic Webhook**: Input and test your Discord webhook URL within the app.
- **Continuous Capture**: Loop photo capture until manually stopped.
- **Professional Logging**: Detailed logs saved to `SneakySnap.log` and displayed in the GUI.
- **Modular Design**: Separates frontend (`SneakySnapGUI.py`) and backend (`SneakySnapBackend.py`) for maintainability.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python 3.6 or higher is installed. Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **pip**: Python package manager (usually included with Python).

### Required Libraries
Install the necessary dependencies via pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python requests tkinter pyinstaller

opencv-python: For webcam access and image capture.

requests: For sending photos to the Discord webhook.

tkinter: Built-in Python library for the GUI (no separate install needed).

pyinstaller: For building the application into a standalone executable.

Setup
Clone the Repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SneakySnap.git
cd SneakySnap

(Replace yourusername with your GitHub username once you push this.)

Install Dependencies:
Run the pip command above to install all required libraries.

Verify Installation:
Ensure Python and libraries are installed:
bash

python --version
pip list

Usage
Running the Application
Launch the GUI:
bash

python SneakySnapGUI.py

The application window will open with fields for webhook URL and delay settings.

Configure the Webhook:
Enter your Discord webhook URL (e.g., https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...).

Click Test Webhook to verify it works. A successful test enables the "Start Capture" button.

Set Delay:
Enter a number (in seconds) in the delay field (e.g., 10).

Click Set Delay to apply it. The current delay will update in the GUI.

Start Capture:
Click Start Capture to begin taking photos at the set interval. Photos are sent to the webhook.

Logs will appear in the GUI and SneakySnap.log.

Stop Capture:
Click Stop Capture to halt the process.

Building an Executable
To create a standalone .exe for distribution:
Build Backend:
bash

pyinstaller --onefile SneakySnapBackend.py

Build GUI with Backend:
bash

pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "SneakySnapBackend.py;." SneakySnapGUI.py

Run:
Find SneakySnapGUI.exe in the dist folder and execute it.

Project Structure
SneakySnapGUI.py: Frontend GUI for user interaction.

SneakySnapBackend.py: Backend logic for webcam capture and webhook communication.

SneakySnap.log: Log file generated during runtime with detailed process information.

Log File
The SneakySnap.log file records all actions with timestamps and log levels:
Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - LEVEL - MESSAGE

Example:

2025-03-14 12:34:56 - INFO - Backend initialized.
2025-03-14 12:35:00 - INFO - Webhook test passed successfully.
2025-03-14 12:35:05 - INFO - Image captured successfully at 12:35:05.
2025-03-14 12:35:06 - ERROR - Webhook request failed: 429 - Too Many Requests

Purpose: Provides a detailed audit trail for debugging and monitoring.

Troubleshooting
Webcam Not Detected: Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible. Check logs for "Webcam not detected" errors.

Webhook Fails: Verify the URL is correct and test it manually with curl:
bash

curl -X POST -F "content=test" YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL

GUI Errors: Run with Python directly (python SneakySnapGUI.py) to see detailed error messages.

TODO
Future enhancements to expand functionality:
Stealth Mode:
Minimize to system tray or run silently without a visible window.

Hide process from task manager (if possible).

Persistence Mechanism:
Add startup registry entry or scheduled task for automatic execution on system boot.

Ensure the app restarts after closure or system reboot.

Encryption:
Encrypt captured images before sending to the webhook.

Secure log file contents with basic encryption.

Remote Control:
Implement a command system via Discord (e.g., start/stop capture remotely).

Allow configuration updates through a remote interface.

Keylogging or Screen Capture:
Add keylogging to capture user input alongside photos.

Include periodic screen captures as an alternative to webcam photos.

Anti-Detection Measures:
Obfuscate the executable to evade basic antivirus scans.

Randomize file names and signatures for each build.
